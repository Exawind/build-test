# Instructions:
# A Nalu do-config script that uses Spack-built TPLs on Merlin.
# Make a directory in the Nalu directory for building,
# Copy this script to that directory and edit the
# options below to your own needs.
# Uncomment the last line and then run this script.

# Note Spack uses rpath so we don't need to worry so much
# about setting our environment when running, but when we 
# build manually we will then need to have some TPLs loaded in 
# the environment, namely binutils, cmake, and openmpi.

# Also note this script won't work on OSX.
# Mostly due to your OSX machine not having
# environment modules so the 'module load'
# won't add to your PATH (and LD_LIBRARY_PATH).

# Set up environment on Merlin
